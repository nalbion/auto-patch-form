<!--
A form which does not require a submit button - it sends a PATCH automatically,
which can be pooled and batched by a [Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/).

The form supports undo/redo and smart merging on the server of multiple requests, potentially submitted by different clients.

<b>Note:</b> There's no point adding <code>method="patch"</code> as browsers will likely convert it to get or post.

Example:

    <form is="smart-form" action="//api.example.com/smart-form">
      <paper-input label="First name" value="{{first_name}}"></paper-input>
      <paper-input label="Last name" value="{{last_name}}"></paper-input>
    </form>

<script src="smart-form.js"></script>
